    <h2>Intro</h2>
    
    <p>I'm a student in the Software Engineering course at Thinkful. I live in Cape Cod, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>As a creative person, I have enjoyed working on graphic design for the last four years. Some skills include:</p> 

    <ul>
        <li> Lettering and Font Design
        <li> Vector Artwork
        <li> Illustration
        <li> 3D Modeling and Animation.
    </ul>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
        <p>As a graphic designer, I face technical challenges every day. While working with clients, I found myself wishing that I could create interactive and dymanic webpages, custom-coded 3D solutions, and manage databases. </p>

        <p>I've joined Thinkful to, not only lay a foundation of coding knowledge â€” but to take that into the creative space. Working with fellow students will help me discover new ways of thinking about code, and I'm excited to see what they will share! </p>

        <p>While I'm not working on school or design, I spend my time meal planning, playing games, and exploring the beaches in Cape Cod. </p>
